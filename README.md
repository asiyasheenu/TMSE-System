- Temperature and Mask Scan Entry System Using Machine Learning in Embedded System Temperature.

The project I made is a temperature and mask scanning system that can be used at the entry of several buildings, campuses, etc. We implemented an ID scanner that can scan your college or work ID but is currently limited to 1D barcode. Also, one of the main concerns with the temperature scanning was that contactless temperature devices were not available when prototyping. So this needs to be in contact for about 3â€“4 seconds. Then the Most advanced technology in the device is the mask scanning made by training and testing with thousands of datasets with custom datasets, in which the model achieved 98% accuracy, which is impressive in the machine learning world. All of this is logged on the local server of the building, which also automates contacting authorities, and as a second package, we made IP Camera access to the building so that not only in entry but also recognize no mask within campus with face recognition, which was implemented in v0.2.0, which is in its early stage but supervised learning makes it improve over time.

## Imp: Use Python == 3.7.*
